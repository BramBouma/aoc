# My AOC

- the first couple of days of the 2024 [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) that I did in Python
- nothing all that interesting tbh, might come back to it and do some more days if I get some time idk
  - day 3 has some interesting regex implementations
  - day 4 is a pretty cool naive word-search algorithm that could probably benefit from some better optimizations
